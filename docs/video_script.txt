## end users
the ideal end users for this application are pretty diverse.
this app would be suitable for anyone who is interested in keeping track of how they are spending their money
so someone who might use this app would be a college student who doesnt have a lot of extra money to spend
so they need to make sure to make wise financial decisions
or it could be a mother who might have a bit more money but make sure she is spending it in the right place
or maybe it could be a small business owner that needs to make sure that they are not making an unnessesary expenses

## why this app is ideal for this project

the reason why i think this application is ideal for this project is that it is very perfectly suited for all the project requirments.
first because its an expense tracking app obviously there clearly needs to be some sort of internal database to keep track of all the
expenses which was one of the first requirements for the project. second is that all the expenses are unique to each individual user so
it makes sense that there will be a sign in feature in our app which was the second project requirement. finally, we would expect that users
would want to be able to track their expenses on the go, so we will be also creating an android mobile application to fulfill the mobile requirement
of this project.

the final reason why i think this application is great for this project is that because this class focuses on agile programming and
this kind of application has a lot of opportunities for growth. After the main app is completed their are many new features we could start 
adding on. For example, we could add more advanced reporting features to the monthly expense report, maybe we could use data visualization 
to show a chart in the report so that users could visualize how they are spending their money. Maybe we could turn this application into a 
budget tracking app, so that users not only track their expenses, but they can also set spending goals and see how close their spending is
in alignment with their goals. Another possibility one of my team members had was that this could become a production scheduling app. in this case
that an algorithm would be used to predict expenses for the following month. So as you can see, using the agile methodology, 
there is a lot of directions that we can expand into by using an expense tracker as the core application.

## mobile app introduction

here I wanted to show a quick introduction to the android app component of our project. I decided to go with an android native app 
because I have some experience in android development already and since this is such a short course I would rather focus my energy 
building the android app and adding on additional features rather than trying to learn Xamarin and C# from scratch and trying to get
just the basic app working in time

so here we have the main screen that shows all the users recent expenses, you can see that each expense has a 
description, category, and date associated with at, along with of course the dollar amoung for the expense. 
Clicking the plus button on the bottom right will bring up a new screen where users can add new expenses.  
So thats the basic design for the mobile app right now, as we progress along in the course we will see what additional 
features we have time to add on, but for now this is the minimum viable product.
